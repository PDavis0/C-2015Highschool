# C-2015Highschool
This is a hodgepodge of project just learning C++ in high school.
I couldn't drive a car yet.

All the code is in each project -> debug -> .cpp files contain code.
This is the typical full project just in each designated folder.

BattleShip was a collaborative project across all members in the class. I had a groupmate and we were unable to figure out how to setup a random 5 ship battleShip board... given we were like 14.
